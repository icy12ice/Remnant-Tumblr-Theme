# Tumblr Theme Remnant v1.0 by icy12ice

A base template for Tumblr that has the nuts and bolts of a theme completed in a layout I haven't seen/found in a Tumblr Theme yet. It's still pretty rough around the edges, so there might be weird CSS issues or missing components of Tumblr functionality I don't use so I haven't styled/coded for. Commented and segmented each section as for what they pertain to for easy reading.

## Layout Overview

This theme contains a sidebar, a place for a header, and a two column based grid for posts.
